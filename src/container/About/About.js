                        I started coding in April 2021 and fell in love with it
                        since. I enjoyed figuring out the logic behind building
                        applications. But I was more attracted to how to make it
                        look delightful to users. That's how I started my career
                        in front end development.

                        After working hours, I spent most of my time learning
                        and experimenting with the new knowledge that I have
                        gained every single day. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on
                        looking for a new role as a front end developer and
                        finding out new technology by building projects.
