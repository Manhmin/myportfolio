                        I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and
                        visual aspects of digital products to life. User
                        experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean
                        accessible, human code matters to me. I sweat the
                        details. And as a follower of John Maedaâ€™s Laws Of
                        Simplicity, I agree that less is more.

                        I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring and
                        thinking about how to make things better. Currently
                        solving deceptively simple problems at UsePastel.Com.
                        I'm not available for any freelance work, but feel free
                        to reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‰
